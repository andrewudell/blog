# Testing Markdown Features

This post demonstrates the various markdown features available in this notebook blog.

## Text Formatting

You can write **bold text** and *italic text*. You can also combine them for ***bold italic text***.

## Lists

Here's an unordered list:

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

And an ordered list:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Code

Inline `code` looks like this. Here's a code block:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

## Quotes

>
> You can have multiple paragraphs in a quote.
