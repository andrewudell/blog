# Welcome to My Notebook

This is the first entry in my digital composition notebook. I've always loved the tactile feel of writing in a real composition notebook—the ruled lines, the red margin, the slightly off-white pages. This blog is my attempt to bring that aesthetic to the web.

## What You'll Find Here

In these pages, I'll be sharing:

- **Thoughts and reflections** on technology, design, and life
- **Projects I'm working on** and lessons learned
- **Things I'm learning** in my journey as a developer
- **Random musings** that don't fit anywhere else

## Why a Notebook Style?

There's something special about the composition notebook aesthetic. It's nostalgic, personal, and unpretentious. It reminds me of school days, of filling pages with ideas and dreams. I wanted my blog to feel less like a polished publication and more like a personal journal you might stumble upon.

## Technical Details

For the curious, this blog is built with:

- **Next.js 15** with the App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom notebook styling
- **Markdown** for writing posts
- Deployed on **Vercel**

The code is clean and simple—no unnecessary complexity, just like a real notebook.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you enjoy reading these pages as much as I enjoy writing them.
